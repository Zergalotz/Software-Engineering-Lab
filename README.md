# Software-Engineering-Lab: Polyglot Systems Workshop

## Executive Summary
This repository serves as my centralized environment for mastering high-level programming languages, specialized frameworks, and enterprise software patterns. It documents my journey in building scalable, maintainable, and efficient back-end systems using Java and Python.

Rather than just a collection of code snippets, this lab is a chronological record of my proficiency in modern software engineering—bridging the gap between raw syntax and production-ready architecture.

Also note, this is where I will work on my knowledge depth both in personal projects and Udemy course work. I will add READMEs and Learning.txt for my thinking, challenges I face, decisions to "Why" I made specific changes or discoveries, and anything related to my engineering growth.

## Mission & Intentions
The core objective of this lab is to build a documented history of technical growth across three software-centric pillars:
* **Logic & Algorithm Depth:** Mastering data structures, memory management, and algorithmic efficiency in both compiled (Java) and interpreted (Python) environments.
* **System Architecture:** Implementing professional design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer) and architectural styles (REST, Microservices, Event-Driven).
* **The Enterprise Bridge:** Developing robust APIs, database integrations, and automated testing suites that simulate real-world corporate requirements.

## Lab Roadmap (Project Index)
This lab is organized by "Development Sessions." Each folder contains source code, unit tests, and a dedicated Systems-Architect README that explains the "Why" behind the technical decisions.

| Session | Title                                         | Key Learning Objective                               | Status         |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **01**  | [Rest API Development](./01_Rest_API_Response)| Data Parsing, Virtual Envs, and requirements.txt     | ** In-progress |
| **02**  | [Python-Data-Engine](./01_Python_Data_Engine) | Data Parsing, Virtual Envs, and requirements.txt     | 📅 Upcoming    |
| **03**  | [Java-OOP-Core](./02_Java_OOP_Core)           | Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Maven Lifecycle       | 📅 Upcoming    |
| **04**  | **Multithreaded Systems**                     | Concurrency, Locks, and Race Condition Mitigation    | 📅 Upcoming    |
| **05**  | **API Integration**                           | RESTful Services & JSON Schema Validation            | 📅 Upcoming    |

## Technical Standard
All projects in this lab adhere to professional software standards:
* **Version Control Rigor:** Utilizing a centralized .gitignore to prevent environment "noise" (e.g., __pycache__, .class, venv) from polluting the codebase.
* **Clean Code Principles:** Emphasis on scannable code, meaningful naming conventions, and comprehensive inline documentation.
* **Test-Driven Focus:** (Where applicable) Implementation of JUnit (Java) or PyTest (Python) to ensure logic remains resilient over time.
