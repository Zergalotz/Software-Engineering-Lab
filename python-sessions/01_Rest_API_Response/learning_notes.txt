APIs
Application. Programming. Interface.

Summary:
An API, is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that engineers can use to create software or interact with an external systems. 
Some examples of external system would be a ecommerce web page creating an customer orders, backend application using storing and pulling data from
a timeserires database about water pressure system, and many other different types of applications or projects.

your frontend web or electronic device | the API | external or backend system 

Endpoint    --> is like a location or an address. // the Endpoint is more then likely a url 
API Request --> there are some requests that would need authentication while there are others that are not needed to authenticate due to be very simple

Question: What are cases we would need to use APIs or related protocols? 
Answer: We need them for any company tht wants to stream data into a compiled location. This could include storing utility data from a electical meter 
or a water meter. There are cases when you want to track a customers order online from purchase to delievered based on tracking data. Banking information
where you want to keep track of customer transactions for end of the year tax forms.

There are different types of protocols, everything from MQTT = Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, WebSocket, gRPC, SOAP = Simple Object Access Protocol
and more. Some protocols are used to communicate with machines (m2m) while others are used for web and backend applications for businesses (b2b).

Question: what possible development tools would be helpful to understand?
Answer: having knowledge of python dictionaries and their syntax and JSON formatting. In the case of JavaScript the understanding of our objects syntax. 
Knowing key:value pairing tools would be important because each language will have its own variation of this format. 

For python you would need import request library and have some knowledge dictionaries and Json would be very helpful.

    if your request hit the endpoint per the api documentation you will get a 200 response back i.e <Response [200]>. If it was wrong or could hit it then
    you would see another message and code. Reference python library request documentation and API docs for what the specific codes mean. 
    Note. if your request was 200, it doesn't mean you will see the data purely from the response value but only the response code. 

    general code meanings = 1xx: hold on, 2xx: here you go, 3xx: go away, 4xx: your screwed up, 5xx: backend screwed up

Question: what if we get a non-successful code back? What should we do?
Answer: This is a great cases for adding, try - catch, for error handling or in this cases if we get a different response status other then 200. 
We can build out logic to print a specific message or route to specific page based on the response. It ensure we have a more "graceful" handling 
so that the client and understand what happened without just seeing there page crash.

Now, when working with resquest module, there is a built-in method that handles the code messages
